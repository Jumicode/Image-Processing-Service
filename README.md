# Image Transformation API

This project is a backend API built with Laravel that allows users to upload, transform, and manage images using Cloudflare R2 as the storage solution. The API supports several image transformations such as resize, crop, rotate, format conversion, applying filters (grayscale and sepia), compressing, and adding a watermark. Each transformation is applied in a chain according to the request payload.

  - **Crop:** Crop a specific portion of the image.
  - **Rotate:** Rotate the image by a given angle.
  - **Format Conversion:** Change the image format (jpeg, png, gif).
  - **Filters:** Apply grayscale or sepia effects.
  - **Compression:** Adjust the image quality to reduce file size.
